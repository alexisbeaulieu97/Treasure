* When creating treasures and adding new unlocked treasures, find a better way to handle unlocking
    * Current: Fails on first file if password is wrong, asks for new password automatically if password is wrong, repeat for every file
    * Wanted: Find files using this password, otherwise fail, then ask to continue/stop -> ask new password if continue
* Using different key on every file (-s)
* Ask password twice when locking treasures
